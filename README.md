# **decision-trees-with-python**

We will use the scikit-learn library to implement decision trees with Python on the 'iris' and 'boston' datasets.






> Code T7-1 : We worked with the iris dataset, which presents 3 species of flowers, to which we implemented 'from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier' to later visualize the decision tree and evaluated the model with cross-validation. We then implemented the random forest with the iris data. 


> Code T7-2 : Taking advantage of the scipy.cluster.hierarchy and numpy libraries, we created a dendrogram for hierarchical clustering, which we modified several times by implementing the elbow method to find the optimal number of clusters 'k'.
